#+title: Solutions to Sofia Santos' (Gralhix) OSINT exercises

[[https://gralhix.com/list-of-osint-exercises/][Link to the original exercises]]

My goal is to solve the exercises, but also scratch all itches I get
during the process. These itches are scratched in the... "Itches"
sections of the solutions below 😄

This project is available on [[https://github.com/alecigne/gralhix-osint-exercises][GitHub]] as well as on my [[https://lecigne.net/projects/gralhix-osint-exercises/README.html][website]]. If
you're on GitHub right now, it might be more comfortable for you to
browse it on my website
