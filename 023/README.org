- The title of the illustration is "[[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lRwWNJ][Involuntary Rat Queen]]" by Adam
  Scythe.

- Creating a similar piece would cost at least $190, as per [[https://www.deviantart.com/adamscythe/journal/Commission-Info-789285042][the

- I started by browsing [[https://www.youtube.com/@gralhix/videos][Sofia's videos]] on YouTube, looking for a video
  posted in October 2023. As I was solving this exercise on
  2024-11-23, I looked for the "1 year ago" indicator. Just give us a
  date, Google...

  See "Itches" below for an alternative to doing this manually.

- The [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gr8yRSPZg][first video]] I clicked on was the right one; however, I also
  checked the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-3tpJl7ktg][previous]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MBUM8C6hX4][next]] videos' date just to be sure: August
  2023 and November 2023.

- I spotted the wallpaper between 3'37 and 3'38. I used the =.=
  shortcut to navigate frame by frame after pausing the video --
  source [[https://web.archive.org/web/20241123223711/https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7631406?hl=en][here]]. Here is the [[https://github.com/alecigne/my-utils/blob/master/screenshot.bash][partial screenshot]] I took:

  This made me consider how to extract the best possible quality from
  that frame. Also, the YouTube player is visible during pause, which
  is annoying. See below for a solution :)

- I used Google Images to do a reverse image search and found:

  + [[https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/adamscythe/involuntary-rat-queen/][This link]], which provides the title and author of the
    illustration.

  + [[https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1bevgh0/for_hire_2d_artist_available_for_full/][This Reddit thread]], in which the author provided a link to their
    [[https://www.deviantart.com/adamscythe/journal/Commission-Info-789285042][commission info]].

- On the latter:

  #+begin_quote
  4. Complete Illustration (character plus background): starts at $190
     (depends on the details)
  #+end_quote

- In conclusion, the illustration is titled 'Involuntary Rat Queen' by
  Adam Scythe, and creating a similar piece would cost at least $190.

** Finding the right video
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

It's not possible to display a timestamp from the channel videos using
[[https://www.tampermonkey.net/][Tampermonkey]] for example, since YouTube is not simply converting a
given date to a "relative" format. The upload date is not in the
channel page at all, only in the invidual video pages.

However, since this "1 year ago" thing could have been very annoying
if there were a lot of videos in the channel, I still wanted a more
general solution.

Using [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]], it's possible to get the upload date of a particular
video:

#+begin_src sh :results output code
  yt-dlp --print upload_date "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gr8yRSPZg"
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
20231024
#+end_src

It's also possible to display all video IDs of a given channel:

#+begin_src sh :results output code
  yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print id https://www.youtube.com/@gralhix/videos | wc -l
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
71
#+end_src

(I piped the output into =wc= to avoid displaying a long list here. To
date there are 71 videos on Sofia's channel.)

So I know I could theoretically write a program that would loop over
all the videos (or do some kind of bisection), retrieve their upload
date, and stop when there's a match. Maybe I'd have to rate limit it
to avoid being blocked by YouTube, but at least I could do something
else while the program is running ðŸ˜„

** Extracting the frame in the best possible quality

To download the video in the best available quality (without sound):

#+begin_src sh
  yt-dlp -f bestvideo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9gr8yRSPZg"
#+end_src

To extract all frames as lossless PNG between two timestamps:

#+begin_src sh
  ffmpeg -ss 3:37.500 -to 3:38.500 -i video.webm frame_%04d.png
#+end_src

The frame:
