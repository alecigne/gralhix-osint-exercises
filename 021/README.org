- I noticed the "Do it right" writing on the chocolate and I ran this
  Google search:

  #+begin_quote
  "do it right" "chocolate"
  #+end_quote

- The first result was:

- So I immediately searched for "puchero valladolid" in Google Maps
  and had a match.

- I recognized the trees that follow the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eresma_River][Eresma River]] from the
  original map, which is actually "upside down" (South on
  top). Rotating the map in Google Maps:

I like [[https://xkcd.com/426/][Geohashing]], as introduced by xkcd. Basically, it's a playful
algorithm for generating random daily coordinates. It combines the
date with the day's Dow Jones opening value, takes the MD5 hash of the
combination, convert the hexadecimal to decimal to create seemingly
random but reproducible decimal coordinates within a given
latitude/longitude region. The idea is for people to meet at these
coordinates for exploration or social gatherings. It is a very fun
motivation for spontaneous adventure! There's even a entire [[https://geohashing.site/][wiki]]
dedicated to the activity with all kinds of challenges: camping at a
geohash, reaching it at midnight, etc.

After this exercise, I wondered what could be the closest geohash to
have landed near our target area since the "invention" of
Geohashing. To check this, I used the [[http://geohashing-shotgun.appspot.com/index/index.html][Geohashing Shotgun]] application
that displays all geohashes in a given area for a given period. And
the winner is: [[https://geohashing.info/t:map/2014-12-10/g:41.6,-4.7/c:41.353,-4.695/z:15][2014-12-10_44_-1]]! At the time of this writeup, 10 years
ago in a few days ðŸ™‚ðŸŽ„
